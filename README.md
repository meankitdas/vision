# Vision Object Detection using Google Vision API

This project aims to develop an application for identifying objects in images using the Google Vision API. Leveraging the power of machine learning and computer vision technology, our goal is to create a robust and efficient system capable of accurately detecting various objects within images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11.5
- Google Cloud
- Vision API

## Features

- Utilizes the Google Vision API for object detection
- Supports detection of multiple objects within images
- Provides detailed information about detected objects, including labels and confidence scores




## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/meankitdas/vision.git
```

## Usage

1. Get into the folder:
```bash
  cd vision
```
2. Open terminal and write:

 ```bash
  pip install google.cloud
```
3. Set up Google Cloud Platform credentials and enable the Vision API. Ensure that the necessary permissions are granted.

4. Configure the application by providing the required environment variables, such as the Google Cloud Project ID and API key.

 5. Run the main.py script:

 ```bash
  python main.py
```

## Usuage

1. Upload an image containing objects to be detected.
2. Submit the image to the application.
3. The application will invoke the Google Vision API to perform object detection.
4. View the detected objects and associated information provided by the API.
